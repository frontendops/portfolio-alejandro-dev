										<p>There is so much that can be built with the fundamentals of Front-End Development. Although, learning and using back-end languages and frameworks such as Node.js, Python, and flask has allowed me to create full stack applications that really unlock a new world of possibilities on the web.</p>

										</span>I love working with technology to make ideas into a reality. Driven by wanting to improve peoples everyday lives with clean User Interfaces, accessibility, and responsive design. To allow every user to experience the web, and not want to immediately press the back button. Originally self-taught the basics of programming but to improve my understanding I enrolled into the Udacity Front-End Developer nanodegree, a 6-month course that is graded by professional developers. Because the course is partnered with AT&T, Google, and GitHub I was able to learn relevant techniques and skills that companies use day to day. My education does not stop there and might never finish, I'm always learning with Udemy courses or working on apps with other developers. In the future, I plan to grow as a full-stack developer and work with mobile applications as well as improve my UI/UX (user interface/user experience) design.</p>

									<h2 class="major">Projects</h2>
									<p>Creating these applications is the reason why I love web development, being able to build something that can help a business grow, make customers happy, help students learn or pretty much anything that your mind can think of, drives me to learn as much as I possibly can to make ideas and dreams into reality. Take a look at some of the projects I have already created.</p>
